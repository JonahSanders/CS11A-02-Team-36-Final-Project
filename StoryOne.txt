Hello! Welcome to Computer Science at Brandeis University. My name is Timothy
Hickey and today's lesson is about $NOUN$ , specifically $NOUN$. This is one
of my favorite lessons! It's really really $ADJECTIVE$ and will be super useful
if you chose to go into a career in $NOUN$ . Anyways, I'm sorry I'm 40.56
milliseconds late, I was $INFINITIVE$ my son because he couldn't $VERB$ yesterday.
Moving on, please go on DiscoveryTeaching and fill out the question I gave you
"On a scale of 1-10, how $ADJECTIVE$ do I look today?" after I want you all to
stop $INFINITIVE$, it's just getting out of hand at this point. Well I hope you
enjoyed today's class and good luck $INFINITIVE$ with Antonella next semester in
COS12B, it's all about $ADJECTIVE$ $NOUN$, you'll love it! Hickey Out!
