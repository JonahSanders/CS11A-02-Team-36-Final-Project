My name is Tim Hickey, and I am a professor of computer science here at Brandeis.
So the idea behind $Noun program is that we bring in students and in $Number hours 
we teach them everything they need to know about building an $Adjective database-backed 
reactive web application, in a team of typically around $Number students. And they go 
present their ideas to $Company. Our focus is on $Noun projects because it's the area 
of computer science that you can have the most impact with the least previous $Noun .
  The United States is in dire need of computing $Occupation . There are projections 
that over the next decade we're going to have a million new jobs created in the Computer 
science domain and I think this is something that could be very $Adjective to students, 
especially high school students, and maybe $Verb them to pursuing a computer science 
major when they get in college.
  It's a wonderful $Adjective about being able to create something which could have
an impact on the world.
