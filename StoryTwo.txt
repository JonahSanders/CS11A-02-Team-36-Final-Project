Hello everyone! Ready for mock interviews? As you all know I $Emotion having
to do this so let’s get this over with as $Speed as possible. Okay before 
we start, I’m going to assume as $Age year old’s you are skilled in $adjective 
this will be very useful in interviews. But remember to not look too $Emotion. 
The three last things to remember. One, you will fail if you are sweating 
$PluralNoun when you finally meet $Professor name. Two, almost everyone here is 
competing for the same job at $Company, that means $Number people for one slot, 
meaning you will probably not succeed in your career in $Noun. Thirdly, my 
recommendation letter is more important than your interview, I am accepting 
bribes in the form of $Food. Okay, everyone $Adjective? Let’s start!
